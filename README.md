# Power-Bi-Plant-Co.-Performance-Report

## Overview
This Power BI project demonstrates a complete data preparation and modeling process. The project begins by preparing data using Power Query and Excel virtual tables. The next step involves building the data model by creating measures, slicers, and calculated columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enhance the analytical capabilities of the report. Additionally, dynamic and visually appealing visuals are created to provide insightful, interactive data exploration for users.

## Data Source
The data for this project is sourced from the GitHub repository **"Plant Co"**. This dataset is used to perform various data analysis and visualizations in Power BI.


## Tools Used
- **Excel**: Used to create virtual tables and for initial data preparation.
- **Power BI**: Utilized for data loading, cleaning, modeling, and creating interactive visuals.
- **DAX Language**: Used for creating measures, calculated columns, and slicers to enhance the data model and interactivity.


  
## Data Cleaning Process
1. **Creating Virtual Tables**: Used Excel to create virtual tables, which were then imported into Power BI for further analysis.
2. **Loading Data**: Imported the data into Power BI and opened Power Query to begin the cleaning process.
3. **Removing Duplicates**: Identified and removed any duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
4. **Column Headers**: Checked the column headers for clarity and corrected any inaccuracies or inconsistencies.
5. **Column Types**: Verified and adjusted column data types to ensure they matched the intended values (e.g., dates, numbers).
6. **Renaming Tables**: Renamed the tables for better clarity and easier understanding of the data model.
